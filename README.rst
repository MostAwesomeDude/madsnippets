This is a collection of simple snippets I've accumulated during the years.

decorators
----------

This module holds an assortment of decorators.
 * memoize
 * trace
 * accepts/returns

hexiom
------

This is a simple decoder for Hexiom saved levels. It can import and export,
and also dump a visual of the solved level. Undocumented and unclean.

kong
----

This is a statistics calculator and printer for Kongregate. Undocumented.

madtools
--------

Iteration tools inspired by #python's unique approach to problem-solving.

 * unnest: Unnests arbitrary iterables.

maths
-----

Several useful maths that could probably be trivially reimplemented. Some
speed hacks are included, but these are largely unoptimized and for show.

 * factor
 * gcd
 * lcm

skype-notify-fdo
----------------

Simple script to send Skype events to the notification-daemon. Not originally
my code; the idea and initial implementation was done by Lightbreeze.

whammy
------

This is an interface to control a Digitech Whammy pedal using MIDI. It uses
PyGTK for a minimal GUI and PortMIDI for MIDI dispatch. Highly hackish,
undocumented, unclean.
