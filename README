This is a collection of simple snippets I've accumulated during the years.

decorators:
    - This module holds an assortment of decorators.
        - memoize
        - trace
        - accepts/returns

hexiom:
    - This is a simple decoder for Hexiom saved levels. It can import and
    export, and also dump a visual of the solved level.
    - Undocumented.

whammy:
    - This is an interface to control a Digitech Whammy pedal using MIDI. It
    uses PyGTK for a minimal GUI and ALSA's amidi CLI tool for MIDI dispatch.
    Highly hackish.
