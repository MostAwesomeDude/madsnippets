This is a collection of simple snippets I've accumulated during the years.

decorators:
    - This module holds an assortment of decorators.
        - memoize
        - trace
        - accepts/returns

hexiom:
    - This is a simple decoder for Hexiom saved levels. It can import and
    export, and also dump a visual of the solved level.
    - Undocumented.

madtools:
    - Iteration tools.
        - unnest: Unnests arbitrary iterables.

maths:
    - Several useful maths that could probably be trivially reimplemented.
    Some speed hacks are included, but these are largely unoptimized.
        - factor
        - gcd
        - lcm

whammy:
    - This is an interface to control a Digitech Whammy pedal using MIDI. It
    uses PyGTK for a minimal GUI and ALSA's amidi CLI tool for MIDI dispatch.
    Highly hackish.
